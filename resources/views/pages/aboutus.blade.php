                                                In 2009, DAF began as a small joinery workshop at Lucknow (India), and
                                                over the next 14 years, it grew into an unrivalled legacy brand.
                                                <br /><br />Since its founding, DAF has been driven by the inspiration
                                                to satisfy customer needs while upholding the greatest standards of
                                                quality, durability and reliability. We believe in customer
                                                satisfaction; hence DAF follows the approach to customize product as per
                                                customer needs with up to 10 ten years replacement warranty on different
                                                products. This straightforward outlook has only strengthened rather than
                                                changed.
                                                <br /><br />Today, DAF is a specialised manufacturer of contemporary
